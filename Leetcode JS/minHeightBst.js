// Write a function that takes in a non-empty sorted array of distinct integers,
// constructs a BST from the integers, and returns the root of the BST.BST
// The function should minimize the height of the BST.BST
// You've been provided with a BST class that you'll have to use to construct the BST.

// Each BST node has an integer IDBCursorWithValue, a left child node, and a right 
// chile node. A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property:
// its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right;
// and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None / null.BST
// A bst is valid if and only if all of its nodes are valid BST nodes.BST
// Note that the bst class already has an insert method which you can use if you WebAuthentication.
