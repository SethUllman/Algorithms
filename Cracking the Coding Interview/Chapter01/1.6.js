//Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. 
//For example, the string 'aabcccccaaa woul become a1b1c5a3. If the complressed 
//string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return 
//the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters(a-z).
