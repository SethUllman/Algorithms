//Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. 
//A palindrome is a word of phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. 
//A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to 
//be limited to just dictionary words. you can ignore casing and non-letter characters.

//EXAMPLE
//Input:   Tact Coa
//Output:  True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc)
